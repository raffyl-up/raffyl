# Raffyl

Raffyl is a decentralized application (dApp) for **fun, fair, and instant raffles**.  
It enables event organizers, creators, and communities to run giveaways where winners are chosen transparently and rewarded instantly on-chain.

## ✨ Features
- **Provably Fair Randomness** — winners are selected using blockchain-based randomness.  
- **Instant Payouts** — tokens are sent directly to winners’ wallets, no delays.  
- **Audience Engagement** — live raffle spin with real-time winner display.  
- **Simple Onboarding** — participants join via QR code + wallet (social/email sign-in coming soon).

- Online raffles for creators and influencers  
- Community rewards for DAOs and social clubs  
- Fan engagement campaigns

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Organizer** sets up a raffle: define prize tokens + number of winners.  
2. **Participants** scan a QR code and sign in with their wallet.  
3. **Spin the Wheel** — organizer clicks *Spin*; results display live on screen.  
4. **Winners Rewarded** — tokens are transferred instantly to selected winners.
